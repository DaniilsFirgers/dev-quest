# Docker overview

## Virtual machine vs Docker container

- Conainters **share the host OS system**, while VM **runs its own OS**. Analogy - everyone is renting their own separate flat vs everyone sharing one house, but have their own rooms.

## Image basics

- You can **search** for an image with the command, where you will see stars and 'official' status:

```
docker search <image_name>
```

- To **list downloaded** images use:

```
docker image ls
```

- To see **docker image layers** use the following command (add --no-truc flag to the full commands):

```
docker image history <image_name>
```

- To **tag** (give an existing docker image a new name or label) the image use the following command:

```
docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE:TAG TARGET_IMAGE:TAG

---or---

docker tag ubuntu:22.04 myrepo/ubuntu:prod
```

- To see how much **disk space Docker is using**, run this command:

```
docker system df
```

## Metadata

To inspect image metadata:

```
docker image inspect <image_name>:<image_tag>
```

In the respective `.json` file you can find the image digest, which is a **unique cryptographic** image identifier, which represents the exact Docker image. It guarantees that the image has not been tampered with and that deployments use the same version every time.

You can also find out what command `Config.Cmd` is fired **when you run the container**, **startup command** `Entrypoint` before cmd, user `User` under which the container is running, ports `ExposedPorts` that container exposes, **environmental variables** `Env` baked into the image. Also, you can see layers `RootFS.Layers` that the image is comprised of.

When you see an array of `Layers`, **each layer represents an instruction** from a Dockerfile (like `RUN`, `COPY` or `ADD`). Each layer is **read-only** and when you run a container Docker stacks all these layers and adds a **writable** layer on top.

**View layers** with:

```
docker history <image_name>
```

## Docker Compose

- To **start** all the services defined in your `compose.yaml` file:

```
docker compose up (-d for detached)
```

- To **stop and remove** the running services:

| Command                                | Description                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `docker compose down`                  | Removes **containers** created by your `docker-compose.yaml`. **Does not** remove **named volumes** and **build images** |
| `docker compose down -v`               | Removes containers, networks and **named volumes** declared in :volumes section                                          |
| `docker compose down --rmi local`      | Removes containers, networks and **images built locally** by compose                                                     |
| `docker compose down --remove-orphans` | Containers **not defined** in the current compose file but still attached to the same network/project                    |

- To show the **status of all containers** defined in `docker-compose.yaml`

| Command                        | Description                            |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `docker compose ps -a`         | Show **all** containers (even stopped) |
| `docker compose ps --services` | Show only the service names            |

## Docker logs

`docker logs` shows the **output (stdout and stderr)** that a container main process has written since it started.

- Standard command:

```
docker logs [OPTIONS] <container_name_or_id>

--- or ---

docker logs my-nginx
```

- Useful options for `docker logs`:

| Option                 | Meaning                                                                  | Example                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-f` or `--follow`     | Stream logs live                                                         | `docker logs -f my-nginx`                       |
| `--tail <n>`           | Show only last _n_ lines                                                 | `docker logs --tail 50 my-nginx`                |
| `-t` or `--timestamps` | Show timestamps with each line                                           | `docker logs -t my-nginx`                       |
| `--since`              | Show logs since a certain time (like 3s, 5m, 10h or absolute timestamps) | `docker logs since 10m my-nginx`                |
| `--until`              | Who logs up to a certain time (only use timestamps here)                 | `docker logs --until 2025-10-04T10:00 my-nginx` |

- Can use `docker compose logs` with all of the above options to see logs from all service
  from `docker-compose.yaml` file.

- You can match logs with the following commands:

  | Command                                                                        | Meaning                                                                                   |
  | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | `docker logs myapp  \| grep "Started`                                          | Search for logs with "Started"                                                            |
  | `docker logs myapp \| grep -i "warning"`                                       | Case insensitive search for logs with 'warning'                                           |
  | `docker logs myapp \| grep --line-buffered "ERROR"`                            | `--line-buffered` makes sure `grep` output matches immediately rather than buffering them |
  | `docker logs myapp \| grep "ERROR" > error_logs.json`                          | Write current logs that match ERROR once to the file                                      |
  | `docker logs -f myapp \| grep --line-buffered "Error" \| tee error_logs.json ` | Show logs output on the screen and save to the file                                       |

## Entrypoint and command

| Directive      | Purpose                                                                    |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ENTRYPOINT** | Defines the **main executable** that always runs when the container starts |
| **CMD**        | Defines the **default arguments** or fallback for the `ENTRYPOINT`         |

1. **CMD only**

```
FROM ubuntu
CMD ["echo", "Hello, world!"]
```

- When we build and run `docker run my-image`, Docker executes `echo Hello, world!`.
- We can **replace** the CMD with `docker run my-image date`.

2. **ENTRYPOINT + CMD Together**

```
FROM ubuntu

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello world"]
```

- If we run `docker run my-image` we get the same result as before.
- But if we run `docker run my-image "Goodbye"`, then ENTRYPOINT stays, and 'Goodbye' is added - `echo Goodbye`.
- So `ENTRYPOINT` is fixed, `CMD` provides defaults or arguments.

3. Overriding

**Override CMD**

```
docker run ubuntu echo "hi"
```

**Override ENTRYPOINT**

```
docker run --entrypoint /bin/bash ubuntu
```

Now `/bin/bash` runs instead of whatever ENTRYPOINT was set.

- To see container from the inside you can run **bash sehll executable** (-it for interactive + terminal):

```
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash my-image
```

- To **jump into a running container** using `bash` or `sh` fro lightweight images:

```
docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> /bin/bash
```

## Removing images, containers and volumes

1. Remove stopped containers

```
docker container prune
```

2. Remove one specific stopped container

```
docker rm <container_name_or_id>
```

3. Stop a running container

```
docker stop <container_name_or_id>
```
