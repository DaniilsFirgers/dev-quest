Etag or Entity Tag is an https header taht acts as a version identifier for a resource.
It lets clients make conditional requests and helps with caching and optimizing bandwidth.

The "ETag" (Entity Tag) concept for web caching was introduced with the HTTP/1.1 specification, with support in web servers and browsers developing through the late 1990s, 
becoming a standard feature around 2001-2002, though work on its underlying principles was discussed earlier, with W3C notes around 1999. 

1. Example response with ETag head
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "686897696a7c876b7e"
Content-Type: application/js

2. On susequent requests, the client can use the ETag value to check if the resource has changed:
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: "686897696a7c876b7

3. If the resource hasn't changed, the server responds with a 304 Not Modified statu
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
IMPORTANT: Cache-control max-age vs ETag


Etag vs Cache:

- Expires and Cache-Control are "strong caching headers".
- Last-Modified and ETag are "weak caching headers"
- First the browser check Expires/Cache-Control to determine whether or not to make a request to the server
- If have to make a request, it will send Last-Modified/ETag in the HTTP request. If the Etag value of the document matches that, 
the server will send a 304 code instead of 200, and no content. The browser will load the contents from its cache.

Depending on your needs it may just add extra bytes in your headers which may increase packets which means more TCP overhead. 
Again, you should see if the overhead of having both things in your headers is necessary or will it just add extra weight in your requests which reduces performance.
