Etag or Entity Tag is an https header taht acts as a version identifier for a resource.
It lets clients make conditional requests and helps with caching and optimizing bandwidt

1. Example response with ETag head
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
ETag: "686897696a7c876b7e"
Content-Type: application/js

2. On susequent requests, the client can use the ETag value to check if the resource has changed:
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
If-None-Match: "686897696a7c876b7

3. If the resource hasn't changed, the server responds with a 304 Not Modified statu
HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modifi
IMPORTANT: Cache-control max-age vs ETag
